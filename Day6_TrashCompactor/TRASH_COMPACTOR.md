# Day 6: Trash Compactor

## Personal Log About My Solution
Part 1 was a little interesting. I believe my line of thinking in finding a roundabout solution worked, and although I truly believe it isn't the best solution, I was able to get it first try. I completely ignored whitespace, where I just put everything into arrays in lists, split off the final row to get operands, and calculated everything together.

Part 2 is funny, because when you look around on reddit and such, you see everyone made the exact same mistake in part 1. Part 1 sort of tricks you into thinking whitespace doesn't matter at all, but it actually becomes really important. The problem doesn't exactly tell the whole story, as it states that we should read right to left; however, we're doing multiplication and addition, so order doesn't matter at all. That said, I struggled with this one, and ended up rewriting it 3 times before coming up with a suitable solution. It's also one I felt I needed the most help with, and while I did my best to avoid GenAI, I used a ton of online resources like stackoverflow and others.
